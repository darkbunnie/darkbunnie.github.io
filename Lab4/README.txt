Visualization 1: Quatized Scale
Run index1.html in a web browser (preferably Firefox) to view the Choropleth Map for Lab 4 parts 1-4.
	Click on a state to zoom in on the state. Click on another state to pan to the other state (Note: This is quite choppy for some reason). Click on the state that is currently focused on to zoom back out.
	To change the colors used in the Choropleth Map, click a button labeled "Choose Color" and choose the desired color. Click outside the selection box to finalize the color selection. The "Choose Color" buttons are organized from left to right in order of low unemployment levels to high unemployment levels.
	To generate a new choropleth map with different upper and lower bounds on the unemployment thresholds use the slider at the top of the page to change the bounds and hit "Generate" to generate a new map which will appear as the last map on the page. Note that you can generate an unlimited number of maps, all choropleth maps use the same colors, and all maps can be zoomed in on.
